# MusicPlayer
A MIDI music player designed from class project.

I designed a working midi music player that takes midi text input and plays it through java's midi library. The software comes with a GUI that allows adding, editing, and deleting of notes that are brought from the input.

The decision to choose this project presents my ability to program efficiently in a high level OO language, and show my current skill up to lambda functions, setting factory methods, and showing code coverage. The project was also designed using the MVC pattern to appropriately construct a basic music model, GUI using the Spring library, and mouse/keyboard controller.

The software is appropriately tested using JUnit. Positive, negative, and edge test cases were primarily used to test functionality.
